## On Rewrite
- [x] Make program not scale aware. In other, define fixed ways of drawing stuff and have them do scaling. Do not include scaling logic to other components of the game
## Others
- Include more debuging lines and print them on scaling, end and stuff
- Isolate funky coordinate maths to as little functions and reuse instead. Very buggy

## TODO:
- Fix scaling
- Add Networking
- Add File for game tracking and stuff like that
- Create Menus for starting games
